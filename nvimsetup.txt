Python 3 and 2 both installed, 3 is in path, 2 isnt (maybe need???)
Python 3 installer has all stuff included (debug symbols, precompiled etc)
Python 3 installed pip install neovim - it was failing, Python 2 was needed for pyuv
after installing both it went well
set both pythons path in init.vim
 -qwindowgeometry 1024x800 for neovim-qt to avoid stupid window

>set PATH=C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;%PATH%
in cmd to install pip install neovim for python2 because its not in path (3 is)

installed ruby https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
and gem install neovim just in case, needs reboot
uninstalled ruby because nvim has gem hardcoded instead of gem.exe and windows is crap

After that :CheckHealth shows






Plug was failing with some path errers
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/issues/583
Used this fix and pathed vim-plugjj

Vimproc is a bit tricky
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\x86_amd64\vcvarsx86_amd64.bat"
SET CPU=AMD64
SET SDK_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\Program Files ^(x86^)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Include
nmake -f make_msvc.mak



Font problem - added
Plug 'equalsraf/neovim-gui-shim'
and
autocmd VimResized * call GuiFont('Consolas:h10')
because 
Guifont Consolas:h10
was never executed or everrided


Omnisharp went well

YCM
Add msbuild to path: set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319
Install cmake and add to path (during install)
python install.py --omnisharp-completer
will use python3 because its in path, will build with latest studio, or use --vs



GitGutter - not workitg
Fugitivo - not working

building with vcvars runned from cmd.exe

Omnisharp - just goto ./server and msbuild - runs fine with 3 warnings


installed winclip.exe to windir


Unity command line - choose pythonw.exe and this args:
